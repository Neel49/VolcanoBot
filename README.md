# VolcanoBot

How I made a prototype for a robot that was meant to travel tough terrain and collect rock and gas samples. 

The Issue: Scientists need to collect data on volcanos to predict future eruptions and generate predictive models. On top of that volcanos are a time machine into the earth's past, giving scientists a glance back to earth's surface billions of years ago. And to do all that, scientists need boots on the groundto conduct expiriments. Currently there's two options and neither are great. They can either used wheeled-rovers which are basically useless when it comes to crossing deep crevasses or climbing steep terrain or scientists can risk the pits of poisonous gasses and hazardous geography and make the climb themselves.  


The solution: Make a new type of rover. One that isn't just able to deal with the hazardous terrain, it thrives in it. Instead of wheels, use pegs that can grapple into the ground. A movement system designed to scour terrain in a way wheels just can't. 

First things first. The pegs. These were build with a rack and pinion system. A pinion is a gear which was connected to a motor and is used to turn this slide back and forth by hooking onto these grooves. These acted as our pegs, digging into the ground and providing traction.

The robot has three sections. The left, middle and right. Each section has 4 pegs.

And each section is connected together with 2 horizontal rack and pinion systems.

And to provide structural support to the rack and system I designed rails that would go between the sections as well
